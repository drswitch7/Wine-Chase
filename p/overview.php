		<h2>Overview of Alcohol</h2>
			<h3>Why Do You Drink?</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
			<p>
				People drink to socialize, celebrate, and relax.  Alcohol often has a strong effect on people - and throughout history, we’ve struggled to understand and manage alcohol’s power. <br/>Why does alcohol cause us to act and feel differently?  How much is too much?
			</p>
		</div>		

		<h3>Why do some people become addicted while others do not?</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>			
Alcohol (ethanol or ethyl alcohol) is the ingredient found in beer, wine and spirits that causes drunkenness. It is formed when yeast ferments (breaks down without oxygen) the sugars in different food. For example, wine is made from the sugar in grapes, beer from the sugar in malted barley (a type of grain), cider from the sugar in apples, vodka from the sugar in potatoes, beets or other plants. Alcohol is classed as a ‘sedative hypnotic’ drug, which means it acts to depress the central nervous system at high doses. At lower doses, alcohol can act as a stimulant, inducing feelings of euphoria and talkativeness, but drinking too much alcohol at one session can lead to drowsiness, respiratory depression (where breathing becomes slow, shallow or stops entirely), coma or even death.

		<h3>Here’s what we know:</h3>

		<div class="topMargin">
			<p>				
		Alcohol’s effects vary from person to person, depending on a variety of factors, including:
	</p>
		<ul>
			<li>How much you drink</li>
			<li>How often you drink</li>
			<li>Your age</li>
			<li>Your health status</li>
			<li>Your family history</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
		While drinking alcohol is itself not necessarily a problem - drinking too much can cause a range of consequences, and increase your risk for a variety of problems.

	<h2>Health effects of alcohol</h2>

	<h3>Advantages of Drinking</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
			<p>
In as much as we try to dissuade you from the usage of alcohol, it is not without its own positive effects. The dividing line between its good and bad is actually in the dosage, therefore dosage is key.</p>

<p>According to Harvard, more than 100 scientific studies show a relationship between moderate drinking and a reduced risk of death from heart attacks, clot-caused strokes and overall cardiovascular causes. Alcohol in reasonable amounts raises your levels of high-density lipoprotein, also known as “good” cholesterol, which helps protect against heart disease. Some types of alcohol are better protectants than others -- red wine, specifically, has a high concentration of polyphenols that can reduce blood pressure. Additionally, the University of Rochester Medical Center notes that moderate drinking can help protect blood vessels in the brain, as well as those in the heart, decreasing the risk for dementia.

			</p>
		</div>		

		<h3>Disadvantages of Drinking</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>			
Many of the drawbacks of alcohol appear when you round the curve from drinking moderately to drinking heavily or binge drinking. Heavy drinking can lead to inflammation of the liver, known as alcoholic hepatitis, and cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver. It also increases blood pressure, can damage the heart muscle and potentially plays a role in the development of several cancers, including breast, colon, mouth and liver, says Harvard. In addition, heavy drinking increases the risk for osteoporosis, particularly in young women, says University of Rochester Medical Center. Alcohol can disrupt sleep patterns and lead to weight gain, given that it serves up 7 calories per gram without offering any nutrients along with it. Drinking can also cloud your judgment, paving the way for destructive decisions such as getting behind the wheel of a car.

				The following information has been included in the event that you would like to learn more about how the use of alcohol can affect your health.
			</em>
		</p>
	</div>

		<h3>Your liver</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>			
Because the liver receives blood directly from the intestines, it takes the brunt of high alcohol concentrations. Heavy alcohol consumption can lead to two serious types of liver injury: hepatic inflammation (alcohol hepatitis) and progressive liver scarring (fibrosis or cirrhosis). Women are more at risk to serious alcohol-related liver injury; they develop cirrhosis at a lower dose of alcohol than men do.  

		</p>

		<p>Heavy drinkers are 3 times more likely to develop liver cancer than non-drinkers.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Your throat, stomach, and intestines</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>			
Alcohol is a cause of long-term throat inflammation that sometimes leads to cancer.
</p>
<p>
Inflammation occurs in part because alcohol reduces contraction of the smooth muscle in the lower throat. 
People who drink more than 21 drinks per week have almost a ten-fold higher risk of throat cancer than those who consume fewer than 7 drinks per week. 
Mouth cancers are six times more common in heavy alcohol users than in non-alcohol users.</p>
	</div>


<h3>Your pancreas</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>
The pancreas is a gland behind your stomach that releases chemicals important for digesting food. Heavy alcohol use can lead to long-term pancreatic inflammation, weakening, and scarring. 
Alcohol can also cause acute pancreatitis, a severe and very painful inflammation of the pancreas.</p>
	</div>


<h3>Your heart and circulatory system</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>
The potential health benefits of moderate drinking (up to 2 drinks per occasion) do not apply to younger people, whose risk for heart disease is ordinarily very low.</p>
<p>
Long-term drinking of more than four drinks per occasion has been linked to a variety of damaging effects on the heart and circulatory system. </p>
	</div>


		<h3>Your brain</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>
Alcohol can cause direct or indirect damage to nervous tissues. Long-term heavy drinking is linked to brain damage and poor mental functioning. </p>
	</div>

<h3>Your endocrine system (hormone regulation)</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>
Alcohol interferes with the hormone regulation of a number of bodily activities. Men who have a history of heavy drinking often have lower levels of testosterone and increases in female sex steroids, such as estradiol and estrone.</p>
	</div>

<h3>Emergency Department</h3>

		<div class="writeup">
		<p>			
Patients treated in an emergency department for an unintentional injury are 13.5 times more likely to have drunk 5 or more alcohol-containing drinks within 6 hours of their injury. Alcohol-related unintentional injuries and deaths include motor vehicle crashes, drowning, falls, hypothermia, burns, suicides, and homicides.
		
		</p>
	</div>

	<h3>Road traffic crashes</h3>
	<div class="writeup">
		<p>
Road traffic crashes are the leading cause of death for people aged 1-34 years. They are also a leading cause of hospitalization for serious injury. Alcohol is involved in around 40% of crashes (LTSA, 2000; NHTSA, 2003).</p>
<p>
Compared with a person with no alcohol in their blood, a person with a blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of 0.10% is between 13 and 18 times more likely to have any crash and 50-90 times more likely to have a fatal crash. (Miller, 2001)
</p>
<p>
Unlike what some people believe, vehicle occupants with high levels of alcohol in their system (high BAC) are more likely to be seriously injured or to die in the event of a crash. (Soderstrom, 1993)
</p>
</div>

	<h3>Alcohol and Violence</h3>
	<div class="writeup">
		<p>
In 1997, about 40% of all crimes (violent and non-violent) were committed by people who had alcohol in their system. (Bureau of Justice Statistics, 1998)</p>
<p>
In 1997, 40% of convicted rape and sexual assault offenders said that they were drinking at the time of their crime. (Greenfield, 2000)</p>
<p>
Approximately 72% of rapes reported on college campuses occur when victims are so intoxicated they are unable to consent or refuse. (Wecshler, 2004)

	<h2>Socio-Economic Effect of Alcohol</h2>

		<div class="writeup">
			<p>
Have you ever sat down to think about the harm alcohol does to you socially and the damage it also does to you economically? The information contained in this section will give you more insight on how alcohol affects you socioeconomically.</p>
<p>
 Alcohol consumption can have adverse social and economic effects on the individual drinker, the drinker’s immediate environment and society as a whole. Indeed, individuals other than the drinker can be affected, for example, by traffic accidents or violence.</p>
<p>
Excessive use of alcohol can have adverse impact not only on the individual user, but also on the general community. Heavy alcohol use has been implicated in increased incidents of violent crime.</p>
<p>
Family units are often affected if one member of the family is a heavy alcohol user. Family issues such as marital breakup, domestic violence and spouse abuse are strongly tied to high use of alcohol.</p>
<p>
Risk behaviors such as drinking and driving and inappropriate sexual behaviors are also common practices linked to alcohol use.
</p>
<p>
Financial problems and job loss are also associated with high risk alcohol use. 
<p>
The work force is impacted as personality and power of judgment deteriorate due to excessive use of alcohol.
</p>
<p>
Drinking can impair how a person performs as a parent, a partner as well as how (she) he contributes to the functioning of the household. 
It can have lasting effects on their partner and children, for instance through home accidents and violence.</p>

<p>
The impact of drinking on family life can include substantial mental health problems for other family members, such as anxiety, fear and depression.</p>

<p>
Drinking outside the home can mean less time spent at home. The financial costs of alcohol purchase and medical treatment, as well as lost wages can leave other family members destitute.</p>
	
	<p>
		When men drink, it often primarily affects their mothers or partners who may need to contribute more to the income of the household and who run an increased risk of violence.</p>
<p>
Social and economic costs cover the negative economic impacts of alcohol consumption on the material welfare of the society as a whole. 

	</p>

	<p>
	They comprise both direct costs - the value of goods and services delivered to address the harmful effects of alcohol, and indirect costs - the value of personal productive services that are not delivered as a consequence of drinking.
